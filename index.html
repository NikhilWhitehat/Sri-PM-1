    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <hr>
     <p id="info">Our 14th Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, was born into a lower-middle-class family of Vadnagar in Gujarat. Narendra Damodardas Modi has a keen interest in politics since his childhood. He completed his higher education in his hometown. When he was at a tender age of 8 years, he decided to join Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Which is popularly known to many as RSS. Even at this tender age, he was headstrong and didnâ€™t want to marry anyone. He always said his life is for his motherland.

At the age of 17, he left his house and traveled around the country to gain knowledge and help people. He was a great follower of the ideologies of Swami Vivekananda. During his journey, he stayed in the several ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda. His life was full of struggle and hardship.
